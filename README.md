MIPS-PONG
==========

The age-old game of pong implemented in MIPS assembly.  Please excuse our mess. It's a work in progress!

## How To Run

This is meant to be run in the MARS simulator.  It uses both the Bitmap Dislay and the Keyboard and Display MIMO Simulator tools.

The Bitmap Display settings should be as follows:
Unit Width: 8
Unit Height: 8
Display Width: 512
Display Height: 256
Base Address: $gp

Connect both to MIPS, assemble, run, and you should be good to go!

## Controls

Player 1 moves using the A and Z keys.
Player 2 moves using the K and M keys.
